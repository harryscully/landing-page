# Landing Page Project
This is a simple landing page built using HTML and CSS as part of my web development learning journey. It was created following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum to practice font-end concepts including:
- HTML structure
- CSS styling and layout
- Responsive design using **Flexbox**

## What I learned
- How to structure a webpage using clean, semantic HTML
- Layout sections using Flexbox

## Reflections
This was my first full webpage using Flexbox. Some things I realised:
- I wrote some redundant CSS and realised I could have reused more classes and used combinators to avoid repetition in my CSS code
- I gained confidence using Flexbox
- Next time, I'd plan my CSS more carefully to avoid too much repetition
